# FocusFlow Todo List

A world-class, front-end only todo list built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It is fully client-side (no build tools, no backend) and persists your tasks in `localStorage`.

## Features


## Keyboard Shortcuts


## Running the App

No build step is required.

1. Open `index.html` in your browser directly, **or**
2. Serve the folder with a simple static server, e.g.:

```bash
cd /Users/bhargavihari/Documents/copilot-experiments/mcp_servers
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/` and use the app.

All data is stored in your browser via `localStorage` under the key `focusflow.todos.v1`.
